        Strike Gundam is the flagship of Gundam Destiny. It had three different forms depending on it's weapon loadout. This version is known as the Aile Strike. This is the Real
        Grade version of it. This took about 15 hours to build and another 7 hours to detail. I have not put the decals on yet but this was another fun one to build.
