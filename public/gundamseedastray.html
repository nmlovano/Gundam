    <p>
        Gundam Astray has had many forms throughout the Seed franchise. Gundam Astray Gold Frame Amatsu Mina is from the Gundam Astray manga. This is a Real Grade but I feel it 
        didn't need too much detail. I felt that detailing the gold parts would take away from it so I left those alone. I added a few metallic blue highlights in spots to add 
        some color and did a little detailing to the head but other than that, I didn't detail it at all. I built some of it's weapons but haven't finished them all yet and I 
        still need to add decals. Overall this kit took about 14 hours to build and was a lot of fun
