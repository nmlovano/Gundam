            This is a list of my favorite Gundams in my collection with a brief history of my love for Gundams.

            My love for Gundam came in the early 2000's when Gundam Wing first aired on Toonami. Shortly after I found Gunpla, or Gundam model kits. That's when my love for 
            Gunpla really began to take hold. When I first started building Gunpla, I was in my mid-teens. I obviously didn't have a lot of money at the time so I didn't have 
            much of a collection back then. Shortly after high school, I joined the Marines. Unfortionately it was at this time that I lost all of my Gunpla. In 2016, I was 
            looking for a new hobby and came across Gunpla when I was on vacation in Tampa. I walked into a store at the mall and found a huge display of them. It was at this 
            point that I decided I was going to get back into building them. When I returned from my trip, I searched Amazon and found a few entry level kits that I felt would
            be a good starting point to get back into them. I had no idea what I was getting into. That was in November of 2016. Since then my collection has grown to about 50 
            kits that range in all sizes. These are some of my favorites.
