    <p>
        Gundam Moon, one of my favorite builds and also the first gunpla I fully detailed. This is a High Grade version but it's a 1/144th scale mode just like the Real Grades.
        With all the detail that went into this one, I was right about 20 hours of build time on this one. I really enjoyed it and felt that I did a great job on the detailing 
        for it having been my first time.
