        Strike Freedom Gundam is the upgraded version of Strike. This is a special edition High Grade that consists of being completely clear. The really wasn't any detail or 
        decals to do for this one as it looks amazing as is. Unfortionately I did break one part while building this one but I was able to glue it on and no one can even tell 
        the difference. This is by far my favorite out of all of my builds so far. It took about 9 hours to build

        Destiny Gundam Heine Westenfluss Custom was an amazing kit to build. It's an alternate version of the Destiny Gundam that has a different color scheme than the original.
        It is the flagship of Gundam Seed Destiny (though not where the series got it's name from, that came from the Destiny Project which was completely different). This is also
        a High Grade but not a special edition like the clear Strike Freedom. My favorite parts about this kit are the oranges (which happens to be my favorite color) and the wings.
        This took about 15 hours to build with all the detailing I did. I never got around to finish the weapons for it though and I have probably about 3 more hours to finish those.
