        This is the 00 Raiser which is the 00 Gundam combined with the Raiser system. This is a Real Grade Gundam which means that it is quite authentic to the series. This one
        took me about 16 hours to build and I'm still not completely done yet. I have to do some detailing and get all the decals done on it so it probably has another 10 hours
        to go roughly.
