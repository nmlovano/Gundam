    <p>
        This is Gundam Crossbone from the Crossbone manga. This is also a Real Grade Gundam and is extremely detailed. This particular model has a mouth that opens and closes
        and also an eye patch over it's right eye. I did detail the face but I never got around to doing the body or putting it's decals on or finishing it's weapons. However, I kind of
        prefer it how it is now. This one took me about 12 hours to complete
