    <h1>Gundam Iron-Blooded Orphans</h1>
    <p>
        This is Gundam Barbatos and personally this is one of my favorite Gundams in the entire franchise. This is known as a Full Mechanics kit and is 1/100th in scale. It's 
        fairly large. This one took a bit less time than many of the others on this list. It doesn't have a lot of weapons and ver little decals. I do still have to do some 
        detailing to it but that should be pretty easy when the time comes.

        This is another Full Mechanics kit from Iron-Blooded Orphans called Gundam Bael. This one only took a few hours as well but just a little longer than Barbatos due to 
        having more weapons. I still need to detail this one as well.
